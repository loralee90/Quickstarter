  (This isn't a sad story, I promise.) When my dad was diagnosed with a
  pretty advanced form of lymphoma, we planned a trip to Malta so he'd
  have something to look forward to while in treatment. He got better and
  we took the trip in 2004. I was captivated with the landscape of Malta
  and delighted by the large numbers of stray cats that lived by the docks
  and sunned themselves on the UNESCO World Heritage sites as though they
  owned the place. Most of the cats ignored us, some of them begged for
  food or ear scratches, but the most interesting ones considered us gravely
  and moved on. I found myself wondering what they were looking for.
  That question became the kernel of this story embodied in the main
  characters: Cilla and Betto. Cilla feels that life will only be complete
  when she finds a good home with people, while Betto is happy being a cat on
  the docks. Their adventure brings them through city, country, water, and
  eventually to a place where both of them can be happy.
  I have added in many of my favorite things to write and draw: architecture,
  art history, cultural history, philosophy, big questions, small answers,
  boats of all sizes, and fish heads."

  This Kickstarter is to support my new film, The White WOLF, - a low-budget,
  intellectual horror-thriller that fuses the structure of a classic werewolf
  story with the Italian Giallo.
  The White Wolf is set in the 1980â€™s on a small island off the coast of New
  England.The film focuses on a terminally ill Patient who is travelling along
  the coast ofMaine to visit a lighthouse remembered from his childhood.
  The island is now the site of a medical clinic, overseen by a reclusive
  Doctor, who is also a lecturer at a local university.
  The non-linear narratives reveal the greater themes of the filmâ€™s premise:
  transformation by way of an unreliable sense of self; an unreliable sense
  of self by way of longings or desires; longings or desires by way of dire
  circumstances. I created a short ASK film to tell you more about this project,
  my process, and how the funding would be used. Click above to see.
  I have had difficulty returning my major films to the internet, because of
  my history of music piracy. For this film I am committed to doing an original
  score so that the film can be watched online by a broader public. So after
  its gallery run, everyone can see this film.
  Those of you who make films know how much teamwork goes into making even
  the shortest films. I ask you to support independent, creative filmmakingâ€”and
  to support it as a producer by contributing to this campaign.
  Thank you in advance, and I hope that you join me on the scary, beautiful
  universe of my new film The White WOLF.
  xoxo,
  Sue de Beer"
